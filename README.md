## Description

Map-reduce implementations in hadoop to calculate average travel times in taxi and Citi Bike between zip codes where the comparisons make sense (i.e. zip codes where there are Citi Bike stations). We wanted to test the hypothesis that there is a threshold below which it is faster to ride a Citi Bike in New York City than to take a taxi. This threshold may vary (or not exist) depending on conditions such as day of the week and time of the day. We compared three categories:
* Total trips.
* Weekdays in rush hour versus non rush hour.
* Saturday mornings versus Saturday nights.

## Data sources:

* Citi Bike system data: January, May and September of 2015.
* TLC yellow cab data for the same periods described above.
